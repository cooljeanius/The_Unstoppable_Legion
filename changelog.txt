0.8.8:

Substantial refining and rebalancing of game so far including:

* Outlaws in scenario 1 and peasents in scenario 15 now have the new "fortified" trait, which increases defences but removes movement allowance.
* Added some woods in scenario 2 so that you can made better use of Owayn and Dueterus.
* Overhauled AI in scenario 3 so that General Karak takes part insome fighting without doing anything suicidal.
* In narrative scenario 8, options for splitting gold affected by which branch you took (so default = more gold for dwarves if travelled by land, more for riders if travelled by cave - this is to compensate for lack of XP-gaining opportunities)
* Changed method that daemons appear in scenarios 9 and 10 to be more evenly distributed.
* Changed map in scenario 11 to make Bhargeest harder to kill.
* Fixed bug in scenario 13 that caused Deuterus to do suicidal things prematurely.
* Changed enemy line-up in scenario 14a so that friendly orcs start under attack.
* Increased size of map in scenario 15 to give you more time to catch up with fleeing units.
* Added footprints to scenario 17, and added a time-limit to prevent gold-milking.
* Added full trails to all maps.
* Heroes now have suitably-sized images, although anyone who wants to draw better images will be most welcome.
* Viktor and Deuterus now mount and dismount using the [transform_unit] tag, which should hopefully iron out a lot of the errors.

0.8.9:

* If you went via 14b, the game still stops at scenario 18 for now.

* Add scenario 20, after 19a.
* If you went via 14b, the game still stops at scenario 18 for now.

* Workaround also in place in scneario 20 for anyone who played beyond scenario 13 before the fix.

0.8.11:

* Add scenario 19b.
* This means that both paths go as far as scneario 20 now.
* Fixed a bug in scenario 14b that caused the elvish allies to be deleted at the end of the scenario.
* Gave Eridith an intelligence trait to make it easier to level her up.
