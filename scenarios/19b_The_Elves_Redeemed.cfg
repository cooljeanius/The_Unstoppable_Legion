Even Prince Sven seemed happy to put his trust in these elves. Truth be told, I was simply happy to be going south. I had no idea what we cold achieve, but all I really wanted was to get as far away from Aldanen as possible."

But if they were in league with Zharagorn, why would they lead us away from his forces in the first place? Maybe I'd let my prejudice get out of control, but I didn't dare let that elvish leader out of my sight for a moment."

History, I was about  to discover, was destined to repeat itself."
