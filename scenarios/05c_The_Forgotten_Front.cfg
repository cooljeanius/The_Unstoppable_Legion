	story= _ "General Karak introduced us to Captain Josephine at the city docks, and as the ship sailed away, we saw General Karak slip out of view, knowing that, in all probability, this was the last time we'd see him alive. Strangely, I was feeling the first flush of hope in a very long time. Viktor had been told that any mission behind enemy lines would mean his death, yet he volunteered anyway. The time was not yet right to explain why this mattered, but I now knew for certain that fate of Suveran depended on him."

	story= _ "Viktor told his soldiers that only those who wished to needed to accompany him to the World's End mountains, but his forces stuck by him nonetheless. For the time being, however, all were at the mercy of the ship. Sailing along the coast was a fraught business, for if the ship was lost, all was lost. The estuary of Blacktop River was notorious for its treacherous rocks, and because of this, a centuries-old lighthouse stood by the mouth of the river."
	background=story/lighthouse.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "But the familiar glow of the lighthouse was nowhere to be seen. As we approached the river, a thick mist descended on land and sea. Knowing it would be suicide to attempt to sail up the river in these conditions Captain Josephine used her skill to bring a boat ashore with a small party on board. With no sign of the mist abating, out only hope was to get the lighthouse running again ... if there was still a lighthouse."
