Strangely, I was feeling the first flush of hope in a very long time. Viktor had been told that any mission behind enemy lines would mean his death, yet he volunteered anyway. The time was not yet right to explain why this mattered, but I now knew for certain that fate of Suveran depended on him."

However, at the moment they were little use. Progress was slow as they guided their mounts through the darkened tunnels. Viktor dismounted and scouted ahead with me and our new guide."
