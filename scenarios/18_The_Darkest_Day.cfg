Getting back to Aldanen was easy. With the Black Emerald destroyed, Eridith could open the portals as she pleased. The armies of apparitions that had dogged us in the caves and mountains were nowhere to be seen. The few fighters who weren't illusions were swiftly outnumbered and dispatched. And the magical mist had gone. But the journey back was far from the triumphant homecoming we imagined. We could not have been more demoralised."

	story= _ "It should not have been this way. For all we knew, Zharaogrn could have made this all up. As we left the cave, we agreed that we would only believe his threats if and when we saw it for ourselves. But it was no use. Deep inside, we knew it was no bluff. The only small mercy was that left the mountains, we saw Aldanen, still standing."

	story= _ "I hoped against hope this was a sign. Zharagorn said he would send the Darkguard after us, and if they hadn't touched Aldanen, maybe it was all a trick. But the reports from my riders quickly put me right. Zharagorn's forces were still out there, patrolling the land and guarding the other towns. Which surely meant that somewhere to the south, the Legion of Zharagorn was assembling in full force."

	story= _ "Unless we could somehow stop this, my home city of Karasov would shortly fall to the dark legions. And if Zhargorn's words were true, and he was to turn it over to Mal-Margheera, everyone in the city would have condemned to the worst fate I could ever imagine."
