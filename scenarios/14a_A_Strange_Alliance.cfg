This was Deuterus's story. It is now my story. I write so that, whatever the outcome of this mission, the brave men and dwarves who ventured with me will be remembered for what they did. I hope this will be the journey of a successful campaign - but as I write this, I fear it may still fail."

	story= _ "Our escape from Thorben was the darkest moment of our journey north. I desperately wanted to prove Deuterus would not die in vain, but it all seemed hopeless. All this time, we had counted on Deuterus to guide us every step of the way. Even with Zharagorn's forces leaving us for dead, everything hinged on making it to this village of Aldanen. And worse, looking at the map, I realised we had fled Thorben heading in the wrong direction."

	story= _ "The only consolation was that as we rode through the pass, a thick mist descended on us, hiding us from anyone who wished to pursue us. But the mountains surrounding Thorben were swarming with orcish tribes, far too many for us to fight through. Our only chance was to sneak through the mountains undetected, and maybe, just maybe, we could make it to the village."
