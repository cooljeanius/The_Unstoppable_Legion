# Scenario Introduction

[story]

	music=underground.ogg
	story= _ "We had escaped the trap set by the elves, but our prospects still looked bleak. The Legions of Zharagorn we had tried so hard to shake off were on our tail again, and this time we had no means of losing them. Worse, far from resting in Forest of Elith-Maranon, we were left more battle-weary than ever."
	background=story/suveran.png
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "Our forces were now at breaking point. It was only a matter of time before Zharagorn's men found us again, and I did not think we could survive another clash. And Arawn-Myegon's prophecies were proving uncomfortably accurate. The journey ahead had been dark and difficult. Friend had turned foe, and foe had turned friend. Every prediction had already come true - that is, every prediction except one."
	background=story/suveran.png
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "'One of you shall not make it, and the other must continue alone.' Those were Arawn-Myegon's exact words, and I now realised there was no escape; the prophecy would have to be fulfilled in full. But who should fall and how? I'd thought long and hard about this. And as we rode away from Elith-Maranon, I finally saw what it was I had to do."
