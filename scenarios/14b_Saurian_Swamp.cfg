This was Deuterus's story. It is now my story. I write so that, whatever the outcome of this mission, the brave men and dwarves who ventured with me will be remembered for what they did. I hope this will be the journey of a successful campaign - but as I write this, I fear it may still fail."

	story= _ "Our escape from Thorben was the darkest moment of our journey north. I desperately wanted to prove Deuterus would not die in vain, but we had counted on Deuterus to guide us every step of the way. Even with Zharagorn's forces leaving us for dead, everything hinged on making it to this village of Aldanen. However, there was one small piece of good news: our destination was north-west, and as we'd chosen the western pass, we were heading in the right direction."

	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "But our optimism was short-lived. The path to the west became boggier and boggier, whilst the routes north were worse. An army of riders and dwarves would be sitting ducks in the swamp. But we couldn't go back and couldn't go south. The only consolation was that as we rode through the pass, a thick mist descended on us, hiding us from anyone who wished to pursue us. Somehow, we had to find a way to get to the World's End Mountains."
