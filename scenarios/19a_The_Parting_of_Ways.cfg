This time, I had no doubt we could trust these orcs - even Prince Sven now accepted Mur'ag-Fargan had nothing to gain and everything to lose from double-crossing us - and yet this journey was far more tense. I honestly had no idea what we could achieve going back south, but I didn't really care. All I wanted was to get us as far away from Aldanen as possible."

Not any sort of trick - I just felt there was some sort of bad news they hadn't broken to us. Had they failed to divert the Darkguard from Aldanen? Had the orcs got lost or trapped in the mountains? I could not bear the thought of either. What else could it be?"

There was probably nothing I could have done to make things different had I realised sooner, but I still felt it a failure on my part. The best chance in a hundred years of peace between man and orc was about to be lost forever."
