	story= _ "Welcome back to The Unstoppable Legion. This is port from the edition for Wesnoth 1.4. So far, only Chapters 1, 2 and 3 and part of 4 (17 playable scenarios plus 3 narrative scenarios) are ready for play. Hopefully this should work in version 1.10, but please report any bugs, balance issues and spelling/punctuation/grammar mistakes on the forum thread. I have now ported all the scenarios that worked in 1.4, so the remaining 4 will all have to be written from scratch. Please bear with me."

Who knows, perhaps you have travelled all the way from Wesnoth, the kingdom they say lies on the other side of the world. But by the time you read this journal, I shall be gone."

I do not write to glorify the battles, although they were necessary. I write, simply that you may remember those who showed courage, and fought, and died, standing up to the Unstoppable Legion."

	story= _ "In the dim and distant past, King Eldrian decreed that his eldest son, Wolfgang, was not suitable to succeed him to the throne. Surprised and angry, Wolfgang departed the kingdom, looking for a way to prove his worth. For months he travelled the land, until one day, whilst exploring the World's End mountains, as far north as anyone had ever mapped, he was drawn to a mysterious cave."

	story= _ "There, he found a crystal, known as the Black Emerald, that granted him unimaginable power. Prince Wolfgang renamed himself Zharagorn, and from miles around, people who craved power flocked to his leadership. Even the dead, fallen mercenaries from ages past with dreams of fortune and glory, rose to serve him. Soon he had a legion like nothing the world had ever seen."

	story= _ "So legend says, when his legion started marching south, nothing could stop him. Dwarven and Elvish kingdoms, Orcish clans and city-states in his path fell one by one. Those who surrendered were allowed by Zharagorn to live on as slaves. Those who resisted were slaughtered."

	story= _ "Only the Circle of Druids came anywhere close to stopping him. They sneaked behind enemy lines and sought to destroy the Black Emerald, still in the cave where Wolfgang discovered it. But before they could make it, Zharagorn himself tracked them down, and the Darkguard, the elite of his army, wiped them out."

	story= _ "Finally, Zharagorn's forces reached Karasov, the capital city. It is said that King Eldrian's forces held out three days before they realised they were no match for Zharagorn's, then the King himself rode to meet his son to give whatever he wanted."

	story= _ "Zharagorn's demands were strange. All he asked was for his father to admit he was wrong to refuse him the throne, and to build a temple to his greatness. And although the generations who tell the story find it strange, when King Eldrian agreed to this request, Zharagorn's forces withdrew, never to be seen again."

	story= _ "That was a long time ago ... But the temple still stood as the centuries went by. No-one dared to desecrate it, fearing that it would lead to his return. And there were the cultists: men who prayed for Zharagorn's return, who worshipped in the temple every day."

The northern border of Suveran had been at peace with its neighbours for generations. Because of this, the northern border patrols were amongst the safest jobs in the army of Suveran, and, as such, popular with nobles who wished to join the army without seeing a day's fighting."
