You will find this book at the bottom of your left saddlebag. I have enchanted it to remain invisible for two days, so when you find this, hopefully you will be miles away from the town of Thorben. But by the time you read this, I will be dead."

I had hoped we would be ignored whilst Zharagorn's attention remained focused on Karasov, but once I had revealed myself, it was not to be. Zharagorn would stop at nothing to see me dead, because of who I am."

	story= _ "We were so close to destroying the the Black Emerald. Zharagorn's forces in the World's End Mountains were weak and flimsy, and one final line of defence lay between us and the cave. But I myself had fallen, gravely wounded in a fight with one of Zharagorn's generals. I was no more use to the Circle of Druids, and there was no time to go back, so I told them to go on without me."

	story= _ "How it ended, I do not know. I do not even know how long it took me to reach the mountain village of Aldanen. All I know is that when I came round, the villages told me of a deadly army marching past their village only two days after we left, with a sense of purpose on their faces. When no word came back from the Circle of Druids, I knew they had failed. Perhaps it would have better if I'd fought and fallen with the others, but I vowed I would never rest until I had my revenge."

	story= _ "After Zharagorn's forces retreated, I knew he would return. It could be years, decades or even centuries, but I would have to be ready when it happened. Soon I learnt that he was studying dark magic to prolong his life. I felt I had no choice but to do the same. Magic this dark only works through the power of the darkest of thoughts. For Zharagorn, it was his greed for power and spite for the King of Suervan. For me, it was my hatred of Zharagorn for his destruction of the natural land, and my thirst for revenge for my friends."

	story= _ "But I now understand that Zharagorn cannot be defeated through hatred and revenge. Zharagorn has a great weapon, and it thrives on these dark sentiments. You, on the other hand, have what is needed to defeat him once and for all. Now that I am gone, Zharagorn's forces will no longer pursue you. You must travel to the village of Aldanen and speak to Eridith, the village's wise woman. She will know what to do."

	story= _ "I am sorry I had to leave you this way, but had I told you what I had to do, I know you would have tried to stop me. All I ask is when you return from the World's End Mountains, you journey to Thorben so that I may have a proper burial. I leave with you my journal, where I hoped to chronicle a victorious quest. It is now your journal ... and now up to you how this story ends. Good luck."
